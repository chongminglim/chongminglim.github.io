	While property damage during protest is common, it is often regarded as impermissible. The “defensive” view of political resistance – which conceptualizes acts of resistance as acts of defense, centering on the potential of such acts to eliminate or mitigate unjust harms – appears to offer us resources to justify (at least some) property damage during protest. In this essay, I bring this view to bear on property damage during protest. First, I show how the view directs our attention to the burdens imposed by specific acts of property damage, rather than by types of such damage. Second, I show how the proportionality principle – a key element of the view – can impose severe constraints on property damage during protest.
