<p>Many political philosophers and theorists argue that acts of political disobedience have a special status or cachet, and thus should be treated differently – more sympathetically. This defense of disobedience generates a demand for dissidents who engage in such acts (“disobedients”) to differentiate themselves from mere criminals. According to an influential view, disobedients must act in constrained ways that communicate to their audience that their actions are motivated by conscientious convictions or considered judgments about the injustice against which they protest. This view is, however, unable to deliver plausible verdicts about the actions of disobedients in deeply non-ideal societies – in which the social meaning of the actions of members of marginalized groups are systematically distorted, or in which there is no tolerance for law-violation in general. In response to these difficulties, this article defends a contextualist view of demarcating political disobedience, which relies on the relationship between an act of law-violation and collective action. Specifically, an act of law-violation is one of political disobedience if a collective claims it as an act that contributes to its goal of enacting social change, and if the law-violator assents to such a claim.</p>

I identify three constituents of state anxiety – "Contagion", "Fragility", and "Value" - concerning the character of disobedience, and the fragility and value of public institutions. I argue that state anxiety can be substantiated or specious, depending on the plausibility of Contagion and Fragility. It can also be significant or trivial, depending on the plausibility of Value. Finally, and focusing on John Rawls, I show how political philosophising about civil disobedience can mirror state anxiety and, in doing so, bolster it.</p>

<p>Public commemorative artefacts (including public monuments) typically mark out some historical subject – typically, a person or an event – as important for a community to remember. This chapter surveys the budding literature on the historical character of public commemorative artefacts. First, it details three typical aims of public commemorative artefacts as they pertain to public remembrance. They declare the importance of some historical subject, impart ethical or political lessons, and foster community identity that is grounded in shared remembrance of the past. Next, it outlines two common problems with public commemorative artefacts. They can present incomplete or distorted accounts of history, and lead people to abdicate responsibility for the past. The chapter proposes an account of democratic public historiography that addresses the problems with public commemorative artefacts.</p>

</summary>
<p>In <em>A Theory of Justice</em>, John Rawls produced what remains the most influential account of civil disobedience and, to a lesser extent, conscientious refusal. Engaging with Rawls’s account and seeking to deploy it to evaluate real-world cases are, however, undertakings beset with difficulties. In relation to civil disobedience, first, Rawls defines civil disobedience so narrowly (as a conscientious, non-violent breach of law undertaken with fair notice, fidelity to the system, and acceptance of the consequences to bring about policy change) that no paradigm example from Gandhi to Rosa Parks satisfies it. Second, Rawls’s three conditions for morally justified civil disobedience – that it be undertaken (1) in response to violations of the principles of justice, (2) as a last resort, and (3) in coordination with other dissenters so as not to overburden the majority’s sense of justice or risk lasting injury to a just constitution – impose extreme restrictions on civil disobedience. In relation to conscientious refusal, Rawls’s approach is equally narrow: he sets aside refusals that would be grounded in persons’ private commitments and focuses instead on refusals grounded in public considerations; his central case is selective pacificism grounded in a respect for equal basic liberties (Rawls’s first principle of justice). This chapter acknowledges the argumentative power and lasting influence of Rawls’s treatment of civil disobedience and conscientious objection, while detailing how his account must be refined – and in some ways radically altered – to address real-world concerns.</p>

</summary>
<p>While property damage during protest is common, it is often regarded as impermissible. The “defensive” view of political resistance – which conceptualizes acts of resistance as acts of defense, centering on the potential of such acts to eliminate or mitigate unjust harms – appears to offer us resources to justify (at least some) property damage during protest. In this essay, I bring this view to bear on property damage during protest. First, I show how the view directs our attention to the burdens imposed by specific acts of property damage, rather than by types of such damage. Second, I show how the proportionality principle – a key element of the view – can impose severe constraints on property damage during protest.</p>

</summary>
<p>Commemorative artefacts purportedly speak – they communicate messages to their audience, even if no words are uttered. Sometimes, such artefacts purportedly communicate demeaning or pejorative messages about some members of society. The characteristics of such speech are, however, under-examined. I present an account of the paradigmatic characteristics of the speech of commemorative artefacts (or, “commemorative artefactual speech”), as a distinct form of political speech. According to my account, commemorative artefactual speech paradigmatically involves the use of an artefact by an authorised member of a group to declare the importance of remembering a subject, in virtue of some feature of the subject. Then, I outline a variety of ways that commemorative artefactual speech can go awry. Such speech can be unauthorised, involve unfair exclusion or incorrect identification, be aesthetically inadequate, invoke clandestine explanations, and be directed at inappropriate subjects. I conclude with a discussion of the implications of my account for resisting problematic commemorative artefactual speech.</p>

</summary>
<p>In analysing the problems with commemorative artefacts, philosophers have tended to focus on objectionable monuments that honour inappropriate subjects. The problems with such monuments, however, do not exhaust problems with a society’s public commemorative landscape – the totality of public commemorative artefacts in general, and the institutions involved in their creation and maintenance. I argue that a public commemorative landscape can implicate authoritative ideas, including stereotypes about people in virtue of their group membership. This contributes to what I term hermeneutical constriction – a situation in which people are given reason to rely on an authoritative subset of the totality of hermeneutical resources that they actually have access to. Critiquing and resisting these problems with a public commemorative landscape that contributes to hermeneutical constriction is fraught with difficulties. Attempts to do so render activists vulnerable to a range of serious criticisms.</p>

<p>The term, "objectionable commemorations”, refers to a broad category of public artefacts – such as, and especially, memorials, monuments and statues – that are regarded as morally problematic in virtue of what or whom they honour. In this regard, they are a special class of public artefacts that are subject to public contestation. In this paper, we survey the general ethical and political issues on this topic. First, we categorise the arguments on offer in the literature, concerning the objectionable nature of such commemorations. Second, we review common political responses to objectionable commemorations. Finally, we identify fruitful areas for further philosophical inquiry on this topic.</p>

</summary>
<p>According to a prominent argument, citizens in unjust societies have a duty to resist injustice. The moral and political principles that ground the duty to obey the law in just or nearly just conditions, also ground the duty to resist in unjust conditions. This argument is often applied to a variety of unjust conditions. In this essay, I critically examine this argument, focusing on conditions involving institutionally entrenched and socially normalised injustice. In such conditions, the issue of citizens’ duties to resist is complicated. I conclude by considering how my discussions may clarify a contemporary problem about engaging in resistance to aid potential migrants who have been turned away by states in accordance with widely accepted rules.</p>

Underlying these criticisms appears to be a strongly held – though underarticulated – intuitive moral judgement that some targets are legitimate whereas others are not. Little philosophical attention has been paid to this issue. My primary aim is to address this neglect. I specify a central part of this intuitive judgement – centring on persons and activities – and argue that there is a principled way of differentiating between legitimate and illegitimate targets. The specification relies on a novel conception of political resistance, which focuses on its defensive – rather than communicative – aspect. I then extend the idea of forfeiture to argue that acts of political resistance are correctly directed when they are aimed at those activities of liable persons that cause injustice. My discussions partly vindicate our intuitive judgements about several controversial cases of political resistance.</p>

</summary>
<p>Social movements often impose nontrivial costs on others against their wills. Civil disobedience is no exception. How can social movements in general, and civil disobedience in particular, be justifiable despite this apparent wrong-making feature? We examine an intuitively plausible account – it is fair that everyone should bear the burdens of tackling injustice. We extend this fairness-based argument for civil disobedience to defend some acts of uncivil disobedience. Focusing on uncivil environmental activism – such as ecotage (sabotage with the aim of protecting the environment) – we argue that some acts of uncivil disobedience can be morally superior to their civil counterparts, when and because such acts target people who are responsible for environmental threats. Indeed, insofar as some acts of uncivil disobedience can more accurately target responsible people, they can better satisfy the demands of fairness compared to their civil counterparts. In some circumstances, our argument may require activists to engage in uncivil disobedience even when civil disobedience is available.</p>

<p>Conscientious disobedients often face the demand to differentiate themselves from criminals whose law-breaking actions are not undergirded by conscientious convictions. Within public and philosophical discourse, conscientious disobedients are often criticised on the basis that their actions render them no different from criminals. I provide a qualified defence of disobedients in this essay. I argue that the differentiation demand can be satisfied even by disobedients who engage in what are typically regarded as radical acts of disobedience. In practical terms, this means that even disobedients who engage in actions such as arson, rioting, vandalism or vigilantism can also successfully differentiate themselves from criminals.</p></details></li><p></p>

<p>In recent years, progressive activists around the world have fought to remove problematic commemorations – typically, monuments commemorating and honoring individuals responsible for injustice, or even unjust events. Many of these problematic commemorations are vandalized before they are eventually removed. In this essay, I consider how the vandalism of such commemoration can transform the public honoring of a target, to a public repudiation or humiliation of that target. I discuss four obstacles to realizing the transformative potential of vandalism, and how they may be mitigated or overcome.</p>

Second, I offer a qualified defence of vandalising tainted commemorations. The defence comprises two parts. I consider two prominent suggestions – to install counter-commemorations and to add contextualising plaques – and argue that they are typically beset with difficulties. I then argue that in some circumstances, constrained vandalism is a response to tainted commemorations which effectively adjudicates the demands of the two opposing views.</p></details></li><p></p>

If effective altruists take their commitment to ecumenicity seriously, they will have to revise their criticisms of many of these charities.</p></details></li><p></p>

Elizabeth Barnes, focusing on physical disabilities, argues that disability is a social category. It depends on the rules undergirding the judgements of the disability rights movement(s). Barnes’ account may strike many as implausible. I articulate the unease, in the form of three worries about Barnes’ account. It does not fully explain why the disability rights movement is constituted in such a way that it only picks out paradigmatic disability traits, nor why only the traits identified by the movement as constituting experiences of social and political constraint count as disability. It also leaves out the contribution of people other than disability activists, to the definition of disability. I develop Barnes’ account. On my account, a person is disabled if she is in some state which is constitutive of some constraint on her legitimate interests. This state must be the subject of legitimate medical interest, and be picked out by the disability rights movement(s) as among the traits they are seeking to promote progress and change for. My account addresses the worries about Barnes’ account. It is also able to include all disabilities, rather than only physical ones.</p>

<p>A central idea of public reason liberalism is that the exercise of political power is legitimate when supported only by reasons which all citizens accept. Public reason serves as a necessary standard for evaluating the legitimacy of political decisions. In this paper, I examine the directive to employ public reason, from citizens’ perspective. I suggest that employing public reason potentially involves them engaging in different types of compromise. I consider how acknowledging these compromises sheds light on public reason liberalism. Public reason may not offer a necessary standard for evaluating the legitimacy of decisions, and the evaluation it offers may not have great weight relative to other moral and political considerations.</p>

<p>John Rawls’s use of the “fully cooperating assumption” has been criticized for hindering attempts to address the needs of disabled individuals, or non-cooperators. In response, philosophers sympathetic to Rawls’s project have extended his theory. I assess one such extension by Cynthia Stark, that proposes dropping Rawls’s assumption in the constitutional stage (of his four-stage sequence), and address the needs of non-cooperators via the social minimum. I defend Stark’s proposal against criticisms by Sophia Wong, Christie Hartley, and Elizabeth Edenberg and Marilyn Friedman. Nevertheless, I argue that Stark’s proposal is crucially incomplete. Her formulation of the social minimum lacks accompanying criteria with which the adequacy of the provisions for non-cooperators may be assessed. Despite initial appearances, Stark’s proposal does not fully address the needs of non-cooperators. I conclude by considering two payoffs of identifying this lack of criteria.</p>

</summary>
<p>One recurring criticism of the best interests standard concerns its vagueness, and thus the inadequate guidance it offers to care providers. The lack of an agreed definition of ‘best interests’, together with the fact that several suggested considerations adopted in legislation or professional guidelines for doctors do not obviously apply across different groups of persons, result in decisions being made in murky waters. In response, bioethicists have attempted to specify the best interests standard, to reduce the indeterminacy surrounding medical decisions. In this paper, we discuss the bioethicists’ response in relation to the state’s possible role in clarifying the best interests standard. We identify and characterise two clarificatory strategies employed by bioethicists —elaborative and enumerative—and argue that the state should adopt the latter. Beyond the practical difficulties of the former strategy, a state adoption of it would inevitably be prejudicial in a pluralistic society. Given the gravity of best interests decisions, and the delicate task of respecting citizens with different understandings of best interests, only the enumerative strategy is viable. We argue that this does not commit the state to silence in providing guidance to and supporting healthcare providers, nor does it facilitate the abuse of the vulnerable. Finally, we address two methodological worries about adopting this approach at the state level. The adoption of the enumerative strategy is not defeatist in attitude, nor does it eventually collapse into (a form of) the elaborative strategy.</p>

</summary>
<p>One of the central claims of the neurodiversity movement is that society should accommodate the needs of autistics, rather than try to treat autism. People have variously tried to reject this accommodation thesis as applicable to all autistics. One instance is Pier Jaarsma and Stellan Welin, who argue that the thesis should apply to some but not all autistics. They do so via separating autistics into high- and low-functioning, on the basis of IQ and social effectiveness or functionings. I reject their grounds for separating autistics. IQ is an irrelevant basis for separating autistics. Charitably rendering it as referring to more general capacities still leaves us mistaken about the roles they play in supporting the accommodation thesis. The appeal to social effectiveness or functionings relies on standards that are inapplicable to autistics, and which risks being deaf to the point of their claims. I then consider if their remaining argument concerning autistic culture may succeed independently of the line they draw. I argue that construing autistics’ claims as beginning from culture mistakes their status, and may even detract from their aims. Via my discussion of Jaarsma and Welin, I hope to point to why the more general strategy of separating autistics, in response to the accommodation thesis, does not fully succeed. Finally, I sketch some directions for future discussions, arguing that we should instead shift our attention to consider another set of questions concerning the costs and extent of change required to accommodate all autistics.</p>
