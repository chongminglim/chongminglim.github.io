The legitimate targets of political resistance. <em><span style=\"color: blue;\">Philosophers&#8217; Imprint<\/span><\/em> 23(1)(8): 1-17.<\/summary>\n<p><small>Abstract: Within public discourse, activists are often criticised for directing their acts of political resistance against this or that specific target. Underlying these criticisms appears to be a strongly held \u2013 though underarticulated \u2013 intuitive moral judgement that some targets are legitimate whereas others are not. Little philosophical attention has been paid to this issue. My primary aim is to address this neglect. I specify a central part of this intuitive judgement \u2013 centring on persons and activities \u2013 and argue that there is a principled way of differentiating between legitimate and illegitimate targets. The specification relies on a novel conception of political resistance, which focuses on its defensive \u2013 rather than communicative \u2013 aspect. I then extend the idea of forfeiture to argue that acts of political resistance are correctly directed when they are aimed at those activities of liable persons that cause injustice. My discussions partly vindicate our intuitive judgements about several controversial cases of political resistance.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/l8fwi4af8tn0oh68uj2th\/Lim-2023-Imprint.pdf?rlkey=nvqt49g2ptp8fn211uuujl67h&#038;dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[PDF]<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.publishing.umich.edu\/phimp\/article\/id\/717\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Link]<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2023.

Civil disobedience is no exception. How can social movements in general, and civil disobedience in particular, be justifiable despite this apparent wrong-making feature? We examine an intuitively plausible account \u2013 it is fair that everyone should bear the burdens of tackling injustice. We extend this fairness-based argument for civil disobedience to defend some acts of uncivil disobedience. Focusing on uncivil environmental activism \u2013 such as ecotage (sabotage with the aim of protecting the environment) \u2013 we argue that some acts of uncivil disobedience can be morally superior to their civil counterparts, when and because such acts target people who are responsible for environmental threats. Indeed, insofar as some acts of uncivil disobedience can more accurately target responsible people, they can better satisfy the demands of fairness compared to their civil counterparts. In some circumstances, our argument may require activists to engage in uncivil disobedience even when civil disobedience is available.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/j11w1eqzme9oci2eh0cpc\/Lai-Lim-2023-JAPA.pdf?rlkey=go42utqk2oyv72u1fyaxabcg7&#038;dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[PDF]<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association\/article\/abs\/environmental-activism-and-the-fairness-of-costs-argument-for-uncivil-disobedience\/B9E1610FE8E4923458AF81B27C9EC582\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Link]<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2022.

The moral and political principles that ground the duty to obey the law in just or nearly just conditions, also ground the duty to resist in unjust conditions. This argument is often applied to a variety of unjust conditions. In this essay, I critically examine this argument, focusing on conditions involving institutionally entrenched and socially normalised injustice. In such conditions, the issue of citizens\u2019 duties to resist is complicated. I conclude by considering how my discussions may clarify a contemporary problem about engaging in resistance to aid potential migrants who have been turned away by states in accordance with widely accepted rules.<\/small><small><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/jwi7xenlvhd9xrkj962sv\/Lim-2022-INQ.pdf?rlkey=xriv3m8g6jn1ujz1oono5ok2a&#038;dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[PDF]<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/T3NESJSIQAKKJXSXQEVS\/full?target=10.1080%2F0020174X.2022.2053739&amp;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Link]<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2022.

Within public and philosophical discourse, conscientious disobedients are often criticised on the basis that their actions render them no different from criminals. I provide a qualified defence of disobedients in this essay. I argue that the differentiation demand can be satisfied even by disobedients who engage in what are typically regarded as radical acts of disobedience. In practical terms, this means that even disobedients who engage in actions such as arson, rioting, vandalism or vigilantism can also successfully differentiate themselves from criminals. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/4uzurpwuphdwx9kff1thn\/Lim-2021-JESP.pdf?rlkey=victplnfp2i3xjkhcx6m8w01k&#038;dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[PDF]<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jesp.org\/index.php\/jesp\/article\/view\/1430\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">[Link]<\/a><\/small><\/p><\/details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2020.

Many of these problematic commemorations are vandalized before they are eventually removed. In this essay, I consider how the vandalism of such commemoration can transform the public honoring of a target, to a public repudiation or humiliation of that target. I discuss four obstacles to realizing the transformative potential of vandalism, and how they may be mitigated or overcome. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/ouhtsbe00qkbgmlwoqian\/Lim-2020-JGE.pdf?rlkey=9jduf6uzfmauykr05ub8pgs1b&#038;dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[PDF]<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/SSKAHAEXJCWFWEPTS5PS\/full?target=10.1080\/17449626.2021.1873165\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Link]<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2020.

Recent events have highlighted the urgency of reaching a consensus on this question. However, existing discussions appear to be dominated by two na\u00efve opposing views \u2013 to remove or preserve them. My aims in this essay are two-fold. First, I argue that the two views are not na\u00efve, but undergirded by concerns with securing self-respect and with the character of our engagement with the past. Second, I offer a qualified defence of vandalising tainted commemorations. The defence comprises two parts. I consider two prominent suggestions \u2013 to install counter-commemorations and to add contextualising plaques \u2013 and argue that they are typically beset with difficulties. I then argue that in some circumstances, constrained vandalism is a response to tainted commemorations which effectively adjudicates the demands of the two opposing views. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/ppcc9rwz6lcrtqbjx53ro\/Lim-2020-PAPA.pdf?rlkey=equuhanf3ygc49dxpv2ltgywh&#038;dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[PDF]<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1111\/papa.12162\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Link]<\/a><\/small><\/p><\/details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2019.

Elizabeth Barnes, focusing on physical disabilities, argues that disability is a social category. It depends on the rules undergirding the judgements of the disability rights movement(s). Barnes\u2019 account may strike many as implausible. I articulate the unease, in the form of three worries about Barnes\u2019 account. It does not fully explain why the disability rights movement is constituted in such a way that it only picks out paradigmatic disability traits, nor why only the traits identified by the movement as constituting experiences of social and political constraint count as disability. It also leaves out the contribution of people other than disability activists, to the definition of disability. I develop Barnes\u2019 account. On my account, a person is disabled if she is in some state which is constitutive of some constraint on her legitimate interests. This state must be the subject of legitimate medical interest, and be picked out by the disability rights movement(s) as among the traits they are seeking to promote progress and change for. My account addresses the worries about Barnes\u2019 account. It is also able to include all disabilities, rather than only physical ones. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/b56jux3szgoptr9sm4cmb\/Lim-2018-Mind.pdf?rlkey=iy83f6vj6iucw51kos1j734ni&#038;dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[PDF]<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/mind\/advance-article\/doi\/10.1093\/mind\/fzy028\/5075767?guestAccessKey=b6ee8ca7-9780-43f7-8bac-4241d63f1e83\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Link]<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2018.

Public reason serves as a necessary standard for evaluating the legitimacy of political decisions. In this paper, I examine the directive to employ public reason, from citizens\u2019 perspective. I suggest that employing public reason potentially involves them engaging in different types of compromise. I consider how acknowledging these compromises sheds light on public reason liberalism. Public reason may not offer a necessary standard for evaluating the legitimacy of decisions, and the evaluation it offers may not have great weight relative to other moral and political considerations. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/tcaet9ii5w717xewvzge8\/Lim-2018-New-perspectives.pdf?rlkey=v6gexky5995ixshn2423amq38&#038;dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[PDF]<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.degruyter.com\/view\/product\/485500\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Link]<\/a> <\/small><\/p>\n<\/details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2017.

In response, philosophers sympathetic to Rawls\u2019s project have extended his theory. I assess one such extension by Cynthia Stark, that proposes dropping Rawls\u2019s assumption in the constitutional stage (of his four-stage sequence), and address the needs of non-cooperators via the social minimum. I defend Stark\u2019s proposal against criticisms by Sophia Wong, Christie Hartley, and Elizabeth Edenberg and Marilyn Friedman. Nevertheless, I argue that Stark\u2019s proposal is crucially incomplete. Her formulation of the social minimum lacks accompanying criteria with which the adequacy of the provisions for non-cooperators may be assessed. Despite initial appearances, Stark\u2019s proposal does not fully address the needs of non-cooperators. I conclude by considering two payoffs of identifying this lack of criteria. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/tsz6h1lryy21z8bbhilmv\/Lim-2016-Res-Philosophica.pdf?rlkey=dnckp4d05f015oj68j12kzteo&#038;dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[PDF]<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pdcnet.org\/resphilosophica\/content\/resphilosophica_2016_0093_0004_0893_0920\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Link]<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2016.

The lack of an agreed definition of \u2018best interests\u2019, together with the fact that several suggested considerations adopted in legislation or professional guidelines for doctors do not obviously apply across different groups of persons, result in decisions being made in murky waters. In response, bioethicists have attempted to specify the best interests standard, to reduce the indeterminacy surrounding medical decisions. In this paper, we discuss the bioethicists\u2019 response in relation to the state\u2019s possible role in clarifying the best interests standard. We identify and characterise two clarificatory strategies employed by bioethicists \u2014elaborative and enumerative\u2014and argue that the state should adopt the latter. Beyond the practical difficulties of the former strategy, a state adoption of it would inevitably be prejudicial in a pluralistic society. Given the gravity of best interests decisions, and the delicate task of respecting citizens with different understandings of best interests, only the enumerative strategy is viable. We argue that this does not commit the state to silence in providing guidance to and supporting healthcare providers, nor does it facilitate the abuse of the vulnerable. Finally, we address two methodological worries about adopting this approach at the state level. The adoption of the enumerative strategy is not defeatist in attitude, nor does it eventually collapse into (a form of) the elaborative strategy. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/woubvn2q6rukjtha91ebx\/Lim-et-al-2016-JME.pdf?rlkey=638e4eeu1ritnqqscpjurnxht&#038;dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[PDF]<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/42\/8\/542.full?ijkey=EVmsTP34SpzhGoJ&amp;keytype=ref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Link]<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2015. Accommodating autistics and treating autism: Can we have both? <em><span style=\"color: blue;\">Bioethics<\/span><\/em> 29(8): 564-572.<\/summary>\n<p><small>Abstract: One of the central claims of the neurodiversity movement is that society should accommodate the needs of autistics, rather than try to treat autism. People have variously tried to reject this accommodation thesis as applicable to all autistics. One instance is Pier Jaarsma and Stellan Welin, who argue that the thesis should apply to some but not all autistics. They do so via separating autistics into high- and low-functioning, on the basis of IQ and social effectiveness or functionings. I reject their grounds for separating autistics. IQ is an irrelevant basis for separating autistics. Charitably rendering it as referring to more general capacities still leaves us mistaken about the roles they play in supporting the accommodation thesis. The appeal to social effectiveness or functionings relies on standards that are inapplicable to autistics, and which risks being deaf to the point of their claims. I then consider if their remaining argument concerning autistic culture may succeed independently of the line they draw. I argue that construing autistics\u2019 claims as beginning from culture mistakes their status, and may even detract from their aims. Via my discussion of Jaarsma and Welin, I hope to point to why the more general strategy of separating autistics, in response to the accommodation thesis, does not fully succeed. Finally, I sketch some directions for future discussions, arguing that we should instead shift our attention to consider another set of questions concerning the costs and extent of change required to accommodate all autistics. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/0ddt5nk1w6uk8iggw4a9h\/Lim-2015-Bioethics.pdf?rlkey=d66ctaiksrgwp6qs3wen8191m&#038;dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[PDF]<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/bioe.12154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Link]<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<\/details><br>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Click on individual entries for more information and to download papers.
